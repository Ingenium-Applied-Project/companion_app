Its engine was based on the Rolls-Royce Nene turbojet.</p><p>Deliveries began in the winter of 1949 but early aircraft soon revealed various minor deficiencies that were corrected in the more powerful and robust MiG-15bis.

Its engine was based on the Rolls-Royce Nene turbojet.</p><p>Deliveries began in the winter of 1949 but early aircraft soon revealed various minor deficiencies that were corrected in the more powerful and robust MiG-15bis.

Canada saw its aviation debut in 1909. Birds' flight mechanics differ from aircraft; humans separated lift and thrust functions. By 1918, airplanes became practical vehicles, evolving wing control methods like wing warping and ailerons. Rotary engines, lighter and air-cooled, were also developed. Initially seen as risky entertainment, aviation gradually inspired hope for widespread use, symbolizing progress and modernity. Canadians envisioned a future where airplanes would be as common as automobiles, anticipating a transformative era of air travel.</p>"

Made from various materials, the Silver Dart made Canada's first controlled flight in 1909. Despite subsequent setbacks and tragedies, including Selfridge's death, a replica flew in 1959 to commemorate the original flight, crashing but without injuries.

Canada saw its aviation debut in 1909. Birds' flight mechanics differ from aircraft; humans separated lift and thrust functions. By 1918, airplanes became practical vehicles, evolving wing control methods like wing warping and ailerons. Rotary engines, lighter and air-cooled, were also developed. Initially seen as risky entertainment, aviation gradually inspired hope for widespread use, symbolizing progress and modernity. Canadians envisioned a future where airplanes would be as common as automobiles, anticipating a transformative era of air travel.</p>"

Made from various materials, the Silver Dart made Canada's first controlled flight in 1909. Despite subsequent setbacks and tragedies, including Selfridge's death, a replica flew in 1959 to commemorate the original flight, crashing but without injuries.

It was the first aircraft put to military use by France and Italy in 1910 and subsequently by Britain in 1912. At the start of First World War, the French air force contained eight squadrons of Bleriots and the Royal Flying Corps flew several in France with the expeditionary force. The Italians had Bleriots when they entered the war. A total of 132 were built in five versions.</p><p>On July 25, 1909 “England’s isolation ended once and for all” when the aircraft designer Louis Bleriot flew across the English Channel in a Bleriot XI. Lateral control was effected by wing warping and by having the main undercarriage wheels castered so that the aircraft could crab in a crosswind on the ground. This device made all operations on the ground very interesting. The Bleriot XI was the first aircraft used in war when it was flown by the Italian air force during the Italo-Turkish war of 1911.</p>"

It was the first aircraft put to military use by France and Italy in 1910 and subsequently by Britain in 1912. At the start of First World War, the French air force contained eight squadrons of Bleriots and the Royal Flying Corps flew several in France with the expeditionary force. The Italians had Bleriots when they entered the war. A total of 132 were built in five versions.</p><p>On July 25, 1909 “England’s isolation ended once and for all” when the aircraft designer Louis Bleriot flew across the English Channel in a Bleriot XI. Lateral control was effected by wing warping and by having the main undercarriage wheels castered so that the aircraft could crab in a crosswind on the ground. This device made all operations on the ground very interesting. The Bleriot XI was the first aircraft used in war when it was flown by the Italian air force during the Italo-Turkish war of 1911.</p>"

By 1928 de Havilland Aircraft of Canada began to assemble and to service Moth aircraft in Toronto. During the 1930s there were more Moths on the Canadian Register than any other type and they became a standard trainer in the RCAF. Very few pilots trained during the 1930s would not have flown Moths.</p><p>The D.H. 60 Moth was the first in a long line of extremely successful light sporting biplanes. D.H. Moths were used for several long-distance flights, including two from England to Australia in 1930, and a flight across the Tasman Sea in 1931. The first Moth came to Canada in 1927 and was used in the Hudson Strait Expedition.</p>"

During the 1930s there were more Moths on the Canadian Register than any other type and they became a standard trainer in the RCAF. Very few pilots trained during the 1930s would not have flown Moths.</p><p>The D.H. 60 Moth was the first in a long line of extremely successful light sporting biplanes. D.H. Moths were used for several long-distance flights, including two from England to Australia in 1930, and a flight across the Tasman Sea in 1931.

CF-100s also served in Europe with Canadian and Belgian units. On retirement as fighters, some CF-100s were fitted as target tugs and others were fitted with electronic countermeasures equipment. The last CF-100 retired in September 1981. A total of 692 were built.</p><p>Although officially designated the “Canuck”, the name never caught on. The CF-100 was known universally in the RCAF as the “Clunk” or “Lead Sled”. The CF-100 had good stretch which allowed for potential of equipment and armament upgrades. The Mk.5 had wing tip extensions added to increase its high-altitude capability.</p>"

As an all-weather interceptor with a long range and powerful radar, it was ideal for northern air defence, and was probably the best all-weather fighter of its time. CF-100s also served in Europe with Canadian and Belgian units. On retirement as fighters, some CF-100s were fitted as target tugs and others were fitted with electronic countermeasures equipment. The last CF-100 retired in September 1981. A total of 692 were built.</p><p>Although officially designated the “Canuck”, the name never caught on. The CF-100 was known universally in the RCAF as the “Clunk” or “Lead Sled”. The CF-100 had good stretch which allowed for potential of equipment and armament upgrades. The Mk.5 had wing tip extensions added to increase its high-altitude capability.</p>"

In 1931, a diesel-powered Bellanca set an unrefuelled endurance record of 84 hours and 33 minutes. A distinguishing feature of all Bellancas was the airfoil shape of the wing struts , which contributed additional lift and stability.</p>"

It was still airworthy when the Museum purchased it in 1964, after twenty-eight years of bush flying in Alaska.</p>"

This very successful design was produced in several versions and flew with the air forces of more than 15 countries. In 1948 it was the first Jet fighter to enter the Royal Canadian Air Force. Here, as in other air forces, it introduced fighter pilots not only to jet flying, but also to cockpit pressurization and the tricycle landing gear. A simple rugged design, the last Vampires were not phased out of the Swiss Air Force until the late 1980s.</p><p>In developing the Vampire, de Havilland applied its expertise in wood construction to manufacture a fuselage of the same type of plywood/balsa wood sandwich used in the Mosquito. The Vampire’s twin-boom configuration enabled the jet tail pipe to remain short in order to extract as much thrust as possible from the somewhat low-powered engines of the day. The prototype sea Vampire was the first jet aircraft to fly from an aircraft carrier.</p>"

This very successful design was produced in several versions and flew with the air forces of more than 15 countries. In 1948 it was the first Jet fighter to enter the Royal Canadian Air Force. Here, as in other air forces, it introduced fighter pilots not only to jet flying, but also to cockpit pressurization and the tricycle landing gear. A simple rugged design, the last Vampires were not phased out of the Swiss Air Force until the late 1980s.</p><p>In developing the Vampire, de Havilland applied its expertise in wood construction to manufacture a fuselage of the same type of plywood/balsa wood sandwich used in the Mosquito. The Vampire’s twin-boom configuration enabled the jet tail pipe to remain short in order to extract as much thrust as possible from the somewhat low-powered engines of the day. The prototype sea Vampire was the first jet aircraft to fly from an aircraft carrier.</p>"

About 190 Reliant SRs were produced.</p><p>The Stinson Reliant SR was also produced in improved models, SR-1 through SR-6 which, though still called Reliant, had a different wing design from the SR.

Registered as NC13464, the aircraft had a number of private American owners until 1948, when it was purchased by Leithold Seaplane Service of Minnesota. This company converted the Reliant to floats in 1949.</p><p>The aircraft became the second (and likely the last) SR registered in Canada, when it was purchased in 1953 by I. I. Handberg and registered as CF-HAW to Lac la Croix-Quetico Air Service of Lac la Croix, Ontario.</p><p>By 1957, the Reliant had had a few different owners and was changing hands as scrap metal rather than a working aircraft. It was then in storage until 1963, when it was purchased by J. E. Culliton of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario and restored by Northland Aircraft Service. The cabin was enlarged and lined with aluminum sheet; new cabin doors were installed and a pilot's door was added. The original plate-glass windows were replaced by Plexiglas and a new full-instrument panel was added.</p><p>After restoration and until 1974, the aircraft was owned by Leslie G. Martin of Barrie, Ontario. It was then acquired by Gordon H. Hughes of Northland Aircraft Service, who restored the Reliant a second time. In 1981, Akela Aircraft Repair of Whitefish, Ontario purchased the aircraft, selling it two years later to the Museum, where it arrived, on floats, in June 1983.</p>"

This airplane was not retired until 1973. About 190 Reliant SRs were produced.</p><p>The Stinson Reliant SR was also produced in improved models, SR-1 through SR-6 which, though still called Reliant, had a different wing design from the SR.

Registered as NC13464, the aircraft had a number of private American owners until 1948, when it was purchased by Leithold Seaplane Service of Minnesota. This company converted the Reliant to floats in 1949.</p><p>The aircraft became the second (and likely the last) SR registered in Canada, when it was purchased in 1953 by I. I. Handberg and registered as CF-HAW to Lac la Croix-Quetico Air Service of Lac la Croix, Ontario.</p><p>By 1957, the Reliant had had a few different owners and was changing hands as scrap metal rather than a working aircraft. It was then in storage until 1963, when it was purchased by J. E. Culliton of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario and restored by Northland Aircraft Service. The cabin was enlarged and lined with aluminum sheet; new cabin doors were installed and a pilot's door was added. The original plate-glass windows were replaced by Plexiglas and a new full-instrument panel was added.</p><p>After restoration and until 1974, the aircraft was owned by Leslie G. Martin of Barrie, Ontario. It was then acquired by Gordon H. Hughes of Northland Aircraft Service, who restored the Reliant a second time. In 1981, Akela Aircraft Repair of Whitefish, Ontario purchased the aircraft, selling it two years later to the Museum, where it arrived, on floats, in June 1983.</p>"

Canadair broke new ground with this design. Four CL-84s were constructed. Even though two crashed through mechanical failure, with no loss of life, the design was considered a success. No production contracts were procured and work on the design was halted.</p><p>The Dynavert featured a wing that could be tilted through 90 degrees, complete with two engines swinging large propellers. Vertical take-off was accomplished with the wing tilted. The transition to normal winged flight was accomplished by slowly returning the wing to a horizontal position. This procedure was reversed for vertical landing.</p>"

Test exercises included the first convertiplane transition from conventional to hovering flight under blind flying conditions, which took place on April 5, 1973. Trials were also carried out from helicopter carriers USS <em>Guam</em> and USS<em> Guadalcanal</em>. In all, 196 test flights were completed, totalling over 169 flying hours. Without a market for the aircraft, the program was abandoned in 1974.</p><p>Canadair stored the CL-84 over the next decade, donating it to the Museum in 1984.

Canadair broke new ground with this design. Four CL-84s were constructed. Even though two crashed through mechanical failure, with no loss of life, the design was considered a success. No production contracts were procured and work on the design was halted.</p><p>The Dynavert featured a wing that could be tilted through 90 degrees, complete with two engines swinging large propellers. Vertical take-off was accomplished with the wing tilted. The transition to normal winged flight was accomplished by slowly returning the wing to a horizontal position. This procedure was reversed for vertical landing.</p>"

Test exercises included the first convertiplane transition from conventional to hovering flight under blind flying conditions, which took place on April 5, 1973. Trials were also carried out from helicopter carriers USS <em>Guam</em> and USS<em> Guadalcanal</em>. In all, 196 test flights were completed, totalling over 169 flying hours. Without a market for the aircraft, the program was abandoned in 1974.</p><p>Canadair stored the CL-84 over the next decade, donating it to the Museum in 1984.

Harvard IIBs were first ordered from Noorduyn in Montreal in January 1940. Noorduyn eventually built 2 800 Harvards for the RAF and RCAF. Canadian Car and Foundry made 550 Mk.4s for Canada and the United States in the 1950s. The Mk.4 had an improved cockpit canopy and greater fuel capacity.</p><p>The Harvard must be considered one of the outstanding aircraft of Second World War and the early postwar years. From 1940 to 1955, nearly all American and British Commonwealth pilots had some training on Harvards. Strong and unforgiving, requiring a delicate touch to keep straight on landing and take-off, it was an ideal training airplane. The Harvard was the most numerous of Canadian-built aircraft, with a total of 3 350 produced. In anticipation of a possible aluminum shortage, a wooden rear fuselage and wings were developed and built, but not produced. A gunnery trainer and target tow version were also developed but never produced. Skis were produced but never installed because a strengthened undercarriage would have been necessary.</p>"

Harvard IIBs were first ordered from Noorduyn in Montreal in January 1940. Noorduyn eventually built 2 800 Harvards for the RAF and RCAF. Canadian Car and Foundry made 550 Mk.4s for Canada and the United States in the 1950s. The Mk.4 had an improved cockpit canopy and greater fuel capacity.</p><p>The Harvard must be considered one of the outstanding aircraft of Second World War and the early postwar years. From 1940 to 1955, nearly all American and British Commonwealth pilots had some training on Harvards. Strong and unforgiving, requiring a delicate touch to keep straight on landing and take-off, it was an ideal training airplane. The Harvard was the most numerous of Canadian-built aircraft, with a total of 3 350 produced. In anticipation of a possible aluminum shortage, a wooden rear fuselage and wings were developed and built, but not produced. A gunnery trainer and target tow version were also developed but never produced. Skis were produced but never installed because a strengthened undercarriage would have been necessary.</p>"

Five Canadian squadrons flew Voodoos as part of NORAD. They were finally retired from the Canadian Forces in 1984 after 24 years of satisfactory service.</p><p>As well as setting a series of speed records, the Voodoo had the best contemporary safety record of any fighter aircraft in the US Air Force.

The original <em>La Vigilance</em> was the company’s first aircraft; it was built in 1918 and made the first bush flight in Canada in 1919. That same year, Stuart Graham, Canada’s first professional bush pilot and a member of Canada’s Aviation Hall of Fame, began his civilian career in <em>La Vigilance</em>, and his wife, Madge Graham, became the first Canadian woman to participate in flight when she accompanied him between Nova Scotia and Quebec.</p><p>On September 2, 1922 <em>La Vigilance</em> crashed into Foss Lake, Ontario, where it remained until 1967, when Donald Campbell of Kapuskasing reported the location of the wreck at the bottom of the lake. The hull, along with metal parts and fittings from the aircraft, was retrieved by the Museum during a salvage operation between 1968 and 1969. The original hull was preserved separately and is displayed next to the reconstructed aircraft, which was built using parts from three different HS-2Ls. Restoration of this HS-2L lasted from 1970 until 1986, making it the largest and longest restoration project the Museum has undertaken.</p>"

The original <em>La Vigilance</em> was the company’s first aircraft; it was built in 1918 and made the first bush flight in Canada in 1919. That same year, Stuart Graham, Canada’s first professional bush pilot and a member of Canada’s Aviation Hall of Fame, began his civilian career in <em>La Vigilance</em>, and his wife, Madge Graham, became the first Canadian woman to participate in flight when she accompanied him between Nova Scotia and Quebec.</p><p>On September 2, 1922 <em>La Vigilance</em> crashed into Foss Lake, Ontario, where it remained until 1967, when Donald Campbell of Kapuskasing reported the location of the wreck at the bottom of the lake. The hull, along with metal parts and fittings from the aircraft, was retrieved by the Museum during a salvage operation between 1968 and 1969. The original hull was preserved separately and is displayed next to the reconstructed aircraft, which was built using parts from three different HS-2Ls. Restoration of this HS-2L lasted from 1970 until 1986, making it the largest and longest restoration project the Museum has undertaken.</p>"

Hurricanes were used in Canada for training and coastal patrols.</p><p>Hurricanes equipped 26 RAF squadrons at the beginning of the Battle of Britain and shot down more enemy aircraft than all other defences combined. The RCAF received its first Hurricanes in August 1939, including those flown by Number 1 Squadron RCAF in the Battle of Britain. Later in the war, Sea Hurricanes were launched by catapult from ships at sea to defend convoys against air attack. A “tank buster” version with 40-mm cannons was used in North Africa.</p>"

Hurricanes were used in Canada for training and coastal patrols.</p><p>Hurricanes equipped 26 RAF squadrons at the beginning of the Battle of Britain and shot down more enemy aircraft than all other defences combined. The RCAF received its first Hurricanes in August 1939, including those flown by Number 1 Squadron RCAF in the Battle of Britain. Later in the war, Sea Hurricanes were launched by catapult from ships at sea to defend convoys against air attack. A “tank buster” version with 40-mm cannons was used in North Africa.</p>"

Unfortunately the specification had been drawn up with First World War in mind. However excellent an airplane, the Lysander proved too vulnerable to survive modern warfare. After 1940, British Lysanders were used for search-and-rescue, and unusual missions such as flying spies in and out of the continent. Canadian-built Lysanders were used chiefly as target tugs at Canadian bombing and gunnery schools.</p><p>Called the “Lizzie”, the Lysander was a remarkable flying machine with excellent low-speed capabilities. A Lizzie drifting backward over the airfield as it flew slowly into a headwind was a remarkable sight at Canadian training bases. Spy delivery and pick-up flights were hazardous affairs during which jet-black Lizzies flew with ladders fixed outside and with the rear cockpits jammed with operatives. Landings took place at night in open country inside France or Belgium on improvised landing areas lit by flashlights held, it was hoped, by members of the resistance.</p>"

Unfortunately the specification had been drawn up with First World War in mind. However excellent an airplane, the Lysander proved too vulnerable to survive modern warfare. After 1940, British Lysanders were used for search-and-rescue, and unusual missions such as flying spies in and out of the continent. Canadian-built Lysanders were used chiefly as target tugs at Canadian bombing and gunnery schools.</p><p>Called the “Lizzie”, the Lysander was a remarkable flying machine with excellent low-speed capabilities. A Lizzie drifting backward over the airfield as it flew slowly into a headwind was a remarkable sight at Canadian training bases. Spy delivery and pick-up flights were hazardous affairs during which jet-black Lizzies flew with ladders fixed outside and with the rear cockpits jammed with operatives. Landings took place at night in open country inside France or Belgium on improvised landing areas lit by flashlights held, it was hoped, by members of the resistance.</p>"

          "body": "<p>The Snipe had a confused history prior to its entry into service. Its early handling problems were not completely solved before beginning squadron operations. Even with 100 hp more power, it was only slightly faster than the Camel which it was designed to replace. Not more than 100 Snipes reached France before the end of First World War. After the war the Snipe was adopted as the standard RAF fighter, and production continued into 1919. A total of 497 were built, with the last not retiring until 1926.</p><p>The Snipe is considered to be the ultimate development of the small rotary-engined fighter. While almost as manoeuvrable as the Camel, the Snipe was much less tricky to fly. One of the outstanding single-handed air battles of the war occurred when Major W.G. Barker, a Canadian pilot, fought off a formation of fighters. After shooting down a two-seater, he was set upon by 15 Fokker D.VIIs. Although wounded in both legs and one arm, he managed to destroy three of his opponents before crashing. He survived and was awarded the Victoria Cross. The fuselage of his aircraft, complete with bullet holes, is part of the Canadian War Museum collection.</p>"

Jack Canary restored the Snipe between 1953 and 1960.</p><p>The Museum purchased the aircraft in 1964. It was the first of the First World War fighters flown by the Museum’s chief pilot, Wing Commander Paul A. Hartman. The Snipe was last flown in June 1967 during Centennial celebrations at Rockcliffe by Wing Commander David P. Wightman. Damaged sometime after, it was recovered and had some work done on it in time for the opening of the new Museum building in 1988.</p>"

          "body": "<p>The Snipe had a confused history prior to its entry into service. Its early handling problems were not completely solved before beginning squadron operations. Even with 100 hp more power, it was only slightly faster than the Camel which it was designed to replace. Not more than 100 Snipes reached France before the end of First World War. After the war the Snipe was adopted as the standard RAF fighter, and production continued into 1919. A total of 497 were built, with the last not retiring until 1926.</p><p>The Snipe is considered to be the ultimate development of the small rotary-engined fighter. While almost as manoeuvrable as the Camel, the Snipe was much less tricky to fly. One of the outstanding single-handed air battles of the war occurred when Major W.G. Barker, a Canadian pilot, fought off a formation of fighters. After shooting down a two-seater, he was set upon by 15 Fokker D.VIIs. Although wounded in both legs and one arm, he managed to destroy three of his opponents before crashing. He survived and was awarded the Victoria Cross. The fuselage of his aircraft, complete with bullet holes, is part of the Canadian War Museum collection.</p>"

Jack Canary restored the Snipe between 1953 and 1960.</p><p>The Museum purchased the aircraft in 1964. It was the first of the First World War fighters flown by the Museum’s chief pilot, Wing Commander Paul A. Hartman. The Snipe was last flown in June 1967 during Centennial celebrations at Rockcliffe by Wing Commander David P. Wightman. Damaged sometime after, it was recovered and had some work done on it in time for the opening of the new Museum building in 1988.</p>"

Popular with the general flying public, Puss Moths were bought by private owners and commercial operators alike. Possessing spectacular fuel economy, several were used for long-distance record attempts. A total of nine Puss Moths were imported into Canada and and a further 25 assembled in Toronto. The RCAF acquired 13 of these for training and transportion duties.</p><p>Australian H.J. “Bert” Hinkler purchased a Puss Moth in 1931 and flew solo from Toronto to England via Brazil, Africa, and Europe. Unlike previous Moths, the Puss Moth had its D.H. Gypsy engine inverted, with the cylinders pointing down to increase the pilot’s visibility over the nose and to reduce, it is suspected, the amount of oil blown onto the windscreen. The wings could be folded for storage in a garage, or towing down a road. The undercarriage struts could be rotated 90 degrees, slowing the aircraft and steepening the glide for landing in small areas.</p>"

Possessing spectacular fuel economy, several were used for long-distance record attempts. A total of nine Puss Moths were imported into Canada and and a further 25 assembled in Toronto. The RCAF acquired 13 of these for training and transportion duties.</p><p>Australian H.J. “Bert” Hinkler purchased a Puss Moth in 1931 and flew solo from Toronto to England via Brazil, Africa, and Europe. Unlike previous Moths, the Puss Moth had its D.H. Gypsy engine inverted, with the cylinders pointing down to increase the pilot’s visibility over the nose and to reduce, it is suspected, the amount of oil blown onto the windscreen. The wings could be folded for storage in a garage, or towing down a road.

MacGillivray operated CF-PEI in Prince Edward Island until 1976, when he retired from the RCAF, and sold the aircraft to the Museum. When the Museum acquired it, this Puss Moth was one of eight known to exist worldwide and the only one licensed and flying in Canada.</p>"

Slow and almost defenceless, it was a successful torpedo bomber against light opposition. Swordfish crippled the Italian fleet at Taranto and helped to sink the German battleship Bismarck. Its main advantage was strength, ease of maintenance, and viceless flying qualities. Swordfish could be flown from aircraft carriers, even in rough seas. By the end of 1941, the wartime Swordfish was confined mainly to anti-submarine operations.</p><p>In Canada, Swordfish operated from the Naval Gunnery School in Yarmouth and the Royal Navy Station at Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. In 1946, Fleet Requirement Unit 743 (RCN) was equipped with Swordfish. Its naval nickname was “Stringbag”.</p><p>The Fairey Albacore went into service early in the war, but proved little better than the Swordfish, which it was intended to replace. In Canada, the open cockpits of some Swordfish were fitted with sliding hoods for more comfortable winter operations.</p>"

Simmons, who bought a considerable amount of surplus war material, including around eight Fairey Swordfish. Simmons kept the aircraft on his farm and few were sold during his lifetime. He did, however, sell one Swordfish to the Canadian War Museum on March 22, 1965.

Slow and almost defenceless, it was a successful torpedo bomber against light opposition. Swordfish crippled the Italian fleet at Taranto and helped to sink the German battleship Bismarck. Its main advantage was strength, ease of maintenance, and viceless flying qualities. Swordfish could be flown from aircraft carriers, even in rough seas. By the end of 1941, the wartime Swordfish was confined mainly to anti-submarine operations.</p><p>In Canada, Swordfish operated from the Naval Gunnery School in Yarmouth and the Royal Navy Station at Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. In 1946, Fleet Requirement Unit 743 (RCN) was equipped with Swordfish. Its naval nickname was “Stringbag”.</p><p>The Fairey Albacore went into service early in the war, but proved little better than the Swordfish, which it was intended to replace. In Canada, the open cockpits of some Swordfish were fitted with sliding hoods for more comfortable winter operations.</p>"

Simmons, who bought a considerable amount of surplus war material, including around eight Fairey Swordfish. Simmons kept the aircraft on his farm and few were sold during his lifetime. He did, however, sell one Swordfish to the Canadian War Museum on March 22, 1965.

Seventy similar aircraft went to the US Army under the designation H-25A. Considered too small, 50 were transferred to the US Navy as the HUP-3. The Royal Canadian Navy received three HUP-3s in 1954. Operating from HMCS Labrador in northern Canadian waters, they reported on ice conditions and conducted hydrographic and oceanographic surveys. The RCN HUP-3s were retired in 1964.</p><p>This aircraft was the last of a line of pioneer helicopters developed under the Piasecki name. Early versions of the HUP were called the “hupmobile” or “shoe”, because of their distinctive shape. A prototype performed the first known loop by a helicopter. A large cargo door in the side of the fuselage could accommodate a stretcher and hoist for rescue work. A floor hatch allowed 180-kg (400-lb) loads to be winched up into the cabin.</p>"

Seventy similar aircraft went to the US Army under the designation H-25A. Considered too small, 50 were transferred to the US Navy as the HUP-3. The Royal Canadian Navy received three HUP-3s in 1954. Operating from HMCS Labrador in northern Canadian waters, they reported on ice conditions and conducted hydrographic and oceanographic surveys. The RCN HUP-3s were retired in 1964.</p><p>This aircraft was the last of a line of pioneer helicopters developed under the Piasecki name. Early versions of the HUP were called the “hupmobile” or “shoe”, because of their distinctive shape. A prototype performed the first known loop by a helicopter. A large cargo door in the side of the fuselage could accommodate a stretcher and hoist for rescue work. A floor hatch allowed 180-kg (400-lb) loads to be winched up into the cabin.</p>"

Early Sabres were similar to their American counterparts, but the Sabre 5 and Sabre 6 had Canadian-designed-and-built Orenda engines. The Sabre 6, with its extra power and slatted wing, was the finest version of the airplane built by Canadair. Canadian Sabres served in Canada and with Canadians overseas, as well as in the air forces of Britain, West Germany, South Africa, Columbia and the United States.</p><p>In the early 1950s, Sabre 2s serving with the RCAF were the only swept-wing fighters in NATO. As a day fighter, the Sabre 6 was unsurpassed in Europe. The first two squadrons of Sabres were transported to Europe on aircraft carrier HMCS Magnificent. Sabres were subsequently flown across the Atlantic to Germany from St. Hubert, Quebec, shepherded by a North Star, via Goose Bay (Labrador), Greenland, Iceland and Kinloss (Scotland).</p>"

The Sabre remained in Scotland until fall 1959, when it was sent to the Zweibrucken air base in West Germany. Stored there until 1961, it was sent to Scottish Aviation in August. By November, it was at an RCAF Depot in London, Ontario.</p><p>Moved to No. 6 Repair Depot in Trenton, Ontario in January 1964, the aircraft was transferred from the RCAF to the Museum’s collection in April that year.

Early Sabres were similar to their American counterparts, but the Sabre 5 and Sabre 6 had Canadian-designed-and-built Orenda engines. The Sabre 6, with its extra power and slatted wing, was the finest version of the airplane built by Canadair. Canadian Sabres served in Canada and with Canadians overseas, as well as in the air forces of Britain, West Germany, South Africa, Columbia and the United States.</p><p>In the early 1950s, Sabre 2s serving with the RCAF were the only swept-wing fighters in NATO. As a day fighter, the Sabre 6 was unsurpassed in Europe. The first two squadrons of Sabres were transported to Europe on aircraft carrier HMCS Magnificent. Sabres were subsequently flown across the Atlantic to Germany from St. Hubert, Quebec, shepherded by a North Star, via Goose Bay (Labrador), Greenland, Iceland and Kinloss (Scotland).</p>"

Created to operate in remote areas, this aircraft series suited the Canadian environment. The RCAF used Fairchilds chiefly for photographic surveys and communication. Civil use in Canada involved largely freight and passengers in the north, and passengers in the south.</p><p>Much of the work to open up Canada᾿s north in the 1920s and 1930s was performed by Fairchild FC-2s, 2Ws, and 2W-2s. FC-2W-2s flew Canada’s first international passenger service between Montreal and New York. In 1928, two Canadian FC-2W-2s were the first to reach the Junkers W.33 Bremen, which had crashed in the Strait of Belle Isle after the first east-to-west trans-Atlantic flight. The Fairchild’s wings fold back for convenient storage, which meant that in the Arctic the airplane could be put undercover with a small snowfence and a tarpaulin.</p>"

Created to operate in remote areas, this aircraft series suited the Canadian environment. The RCAF used Fairchilds chiefly for photographic surveys and communication. Civil use in Canada involved largely freight and passengers in the north, and passengers in the south.</p><p>Much of the work to open up Canada᾿s north in the 1920s and 1930s was performed by Fairchild FC-2s, 2Ws, and 2W-2s. FC-2W-2s flew Canada’s first international passenger service between Montreal and New York. In 1928, two Canadian FC-2W-2s were the first to reach the Junkers W.33 Bremen, which had crashed in the Strait of Belle Isle after the first east-to-west trans-Atlantic flight. The Fairchild’s wings fold back for convenient storage, which meant that in the Arctic the airplane could be put undercover with a small snowfence and a tarpaulin.</p>"

Because of its relatively short range, the G.IV served mainly as a tactical bomber, and operated close to the front lines. The G.IV flew both day and night operations, but, as the war progressed, was restricted increasingly to night missions. A.E.G. units operated in France, Romania, Greece, and Italy.</p><p>Many night operations were nuisance raids with no specific targets, but with the intention of disrupting sleep and perhaps doing some damage. The crew was equipped with electrically heated suits and the aircraft fitted with radios. The G.IV is the only surviving aircraft displaying the distinctive German First World War \"night lozenge\" camouflage pattern. Although the rear gunner's cockpit is on the top of the fuselage, his position was equipped with a hinged window in the floor for viewing and fending off pursuing aircraft.</p>"

The G.IV flew both day and night operations, but, as the war progressed, was restricted increasingly to night missions. A.E.G. units operated in France, Romania, Greece, and Italy.</p><p>Many night operations were nuisance raids with no specific targets, but with the intention of disrupting sleep and perhaps doing some damage. The crew was equipped with electrically heated suits and the aircraft fitted with radios. The G.IV is the only surviving aircraft displaying the distinctive German First World War \"night lozenge\" camouflage pattern.

The RCAF version, which served until 1947, was the Cornell III, manufactured by Fleet Aircraft, Fort Erie, Ontario. In late 1943 a series of wing failures occurred, requiring reinforcement of the main spar. After the war many Cornells were sold for civilian use, but the wing spar problem continued and required stringent annual inspections. This weakness greatly reduced their popularity. Canada built 1 642.</p><p>Although Cornells were also manufactured in Canada for the US Army Air Forces, none was delivered there. Most of the US Army Air Forces order was sent to the RAF under lend-lease, with the balance going to the RCAF. Twenty Canadian-built Cornells were used by the Royal Norwegian Air Force at their two wartime bases in Ontario. Some Canadian-built Cornell IIs were shipped to Africa and India to be used in training schools.</p>"

The RCAF version, which served until 1947, was the Cornell III, manufactured by Fleet Aircraft, Fort Erie, Ontario. In late 1943 a series of wing failures occurred, requiring reinforcement of the main spar. After the war many Cornells were sold for civilian use, but the wing spar problem continued and required stringent annual inspections. This weakness greatly reduced their popularity. Canada built 1 642.</p><p>Although Cornells were also manufactured in Canada for the US Army Air Forces, none was delivered there. Most of the US Army Air Forces order was sent to the RAF under lend-lease, with the balance going to the RCAF. Twenty Canadian-built Cornells were used by the Royal Norwegian Air Force at their two wartime bases in Ontario. Some Canadian-built Cornell IIs were shipped to Africa and India to be used in training schools.</p>"
